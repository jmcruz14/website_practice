                    Hi! Welcome to my personal write-up section of my favorite artists. 
                    These are musicians who've creatively inspired me in different ways, 
                    whether they are minute or big in their influence. Much of what is 
                    written here is just my own personal opinion. If you don't like what 
                    you see, feel free to fight me by tagging me on twitter @tuesjays. I promise you we'll have a fun discussion.
                </p>

                <h3>JPEGMAFIA</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                    Devon Hendyrx is a savant when it comes to conjuring up left-field music that is 
                    digestible, incomprehensible, and indescribable. It's the type of chaos that his 
                    persona, JPEGMAFIA, embodies so well. He teaches me the most important thing 
                    when it comes to creating a meaningful piece of art: do your own thing.

                <h3>Magdalena Bay</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                    This "sibling-ship" of Mica Tenenbaum and Matthew Lewin which defines Magdalena 
                    Bay is something that follows in the same DIY nature as JPEGMAFIA. While not the 
                    exact same genre, they dabble in music that is heavily electro-pop, and most 
                    especially reeks of the Britney Spears Blackout-era glamour hiding inside 
                    nostalgia for 2000's internet age and the public domain drivel of Geocities GIFs. 
                    This is the type of music that makes me want to dance in a bedroom glitching away 
                    in my mind as Mica sings with a heavenly praise for love, animals, and secrets. 
                    Digital, digital, digital.

            <h3>LONER</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                Lean Ordinario, or LONER, for short, focuses his art on house music that is 
                uniquely Filipino. A MixMag writer once described his music as "Tagalog House", 
                and while I don't fancy Manila-centric terminologies, the feeling of being 
                one-of-a-kind in his craft is something that I value. There's also an 
                aesthetically appealing method to his music, all draped in silver and platinum 
                and parks and graffiti-font lettering.
