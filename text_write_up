Hi! Welcome to my personal write-up section of my favorite artists. These are musicians who've creatively inspired me in different ways, whether they are minute or big in their influence. Much of what is written here is just my own personal opinion. If you don't like what you see, feel free to fight me by tagging me on twitter @tuesjays. I promise you we'll have a fun discussion.

JPEGMAFIA
Devon Hendyrx is a savant when it comes to conjuring up left-field music that is digestible, incomprehensible, and indescribable. It's the type of chaos that his persona, JPEGMAFIA, embodies so well. He teaches me the most important thing when it comes to creating a meaningful piece of art: do your own thing.

Magdalena Bay
This "sibling-ship" of Mica Tenenbaum and Matthew Lewin which defines Magdalena Bay is something that follows in the same DIY nature as JPEGMAFIA. While not the exact same genre, they dabble in music that is heavily electro-pop, and most especially reeks of the Britney Spears Blackout-era glamour hiding inside nostalgia for 2000's internet age and the public domain drivel of Geocities GIFs. This is the type of music that makes me want to dance in a bedroom glitching away in my mind as Mica sings with a heavenly praise for love, animals, and secrets. Digital, digital, digital.

LONER
Lean Ordinario, or LONER, for short, focuses his art on house music that is uniquely Filipino. A MixMag writer once described his music as "Tagalog House", and while I don't fancy Manila-centric terminologies, the feeling of being one-of-a-kind in his craft is something that I value. There's also an aesthetically appealing method to his music, all draped in silver and platinum and parks and graffiti-font lettering.
